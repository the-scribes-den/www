        <p><strong>Let’s get one thing straight:</strong> A high body count isn’t a red flag. It’s not a scandal. It’s simply a story—a timeline of experience, healing, choices, and growth. And no part of that story should ever come with shame.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>🧠 Experience ≠ Shame</h2>
        <p>Whether it’s 3 or 300, what matters is what’s been learned—not how often. People with more romantic experience tend to bring:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Clearer boundaries</li>
          <li>Better communication</li>
          <li>Stronger emotional intelligence</li>
          <li>Real confidence (not ego)</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>🗣️ Confidence Speaks Louder</h2>
        <p>They've done the work. They’ve made mistakes. They’ve healed. They’re not looking for rescue—they’re looking for respect. And that’s powerful.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>⚖️ The Double Standard is Dead</h2>
        <p>We celebrate men for “conquering” but criticize women for the same choices? It’s hypocrisy wrapped in insecurity. It’s time we grow past it.</p>
        <blockquote>
          We don’t judge people for how many cities they’ve lived in. So why judge them for how many people they’ve loved?
        </blockquote>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>🛠️ It’s Not About Numbers</h2>
        <p>It’s about autonomy. Ownership. Intention. A “high body count” might mean someone took time to explore, to heal, to understand who they are—and what they want. That takes courage.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>💬 Final Word</h2>
        <p>It’s 2025. Let’s stop measuring someone’s worth by what they’ve done in private. What matters is who they are in front of you now.</p>
        <blockquote>
          If someone has a high body count, it means they’ve lived. They’ve learned. They’ve grown. And that’s something to respect—not ridicule.
